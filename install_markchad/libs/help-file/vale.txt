[ Vale Prose Linter ]

Vale is installed along with the other servers during the Post Install phase but an initialization is required for its use.
To do this copy the following code into a '.vale.ini' file in the home directory:

StylesPath = ~/.local/share/vale/styles

MinAlertLevel = suggestion

Packages = RedHat, alex

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, RedHat, alex

Then download the dictionaries with the command:
 
~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/vale/vale sync

When the installation of dictionaries is finished upon saving a Markdown file, the language check provided by Vale will be activated.
