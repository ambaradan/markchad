[ Project purpose ]
    
Create a configuration of NvChad dedicated to writing documentation with Markdown code by implementing the following features.   

* Automatically set Neovim options for Markdown files
* Highlighting Markdown tags in the buffer
* Providing a zen mode for document editing
 
The script was created and tested on a Rocky Linux 9.4 system.   
Consequently, all commands refer to a RHEL based system, especially the commands for installing the required packages.  
In case you are using another Linux distribution, you should adapt them to your own distribution.
