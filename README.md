# WIP - markchad

## Objective

Create a configuration of NvChad dedicated to writing documentation with Markdown code by implementing the following features.

* Automatically set Neovim options for Markdown files
* Highlighting Markdown tags in the buffer
* Providing a *zen mode* for document editing

## Introduction

[Nvchad](https://nvchad.com/) is a custom configuration of **Neovim** that provides *out of the box* an IDE for *Lua* code development, its modularity however allows useful features for any type of language to be implemented in the configuration.
This project intends to create a version of the NvChad configuration with the best solutions for the Markdown language provided by Neovim plugins and settings.
There are also features useful for project management both in terms of workspace management (file manager, session manager) and *git* repository management.

## Caratteristiche

### Configurazione

Tutte le configurazioni dei plugin aggiuntivi sono state scritte prestando la massima attenzione a renderle indipendenti le une dalle altre, questo permette di disabilitarle all'occorrenza mediante il *Plugin Spec* `enabled = false/true` di *lazy.nvim* presente in tutti i file di configurazione. Le chiavi da tastiera per richiamare le varie funzionalit√† sono state incluse nei file di configurazione e convertite dove possibile nel formato *lazy style*.

*NOTE:** This project was developed using the [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/) distribution and should therefore run on all derived RHEL distributions, for instructions on package installation and configurations on another Linux system please refer to the relevant documentations.

## Test installation

For its installation, it is recommended to start with a test one using the `NVIM_APPNAME` variable provided by Neovim. Using this variable allows you to run an instance of Neovim with the **markchad** configuration completely independent of the current system configuration found in `.config/nvim`. To run the installation, type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ambaradan/markchad.git ~/.config/markchad && NVIM_APPNAME=markchad nvim
```

The command clones the installation in `~/.config/markchad/` and starts *nvim* with the settings from that path, installs all set plugins and parsers, when finished all that remains is to install the LSP set with `:MasonInstallAll`.

The neovim instance creates two folders where to hold the additional files of the installation, in particular the folder `~/.local/share/markchad/` will be created where to save plugins (lazy) and LSP components (mason) and the folder `~/.cache/markchad/` for temporary files.

## Starting the installation

To keep the installation independent of the system installation, its post-installation startup must also be done using the NVIM_APPNAME variable, so neovim will initialize the instance with the paths described above, to start it type:

```bash
NVIM_APPNAME=markchad nvim
```

## Removal

For complete deletion of the installation, simply remove the folders created by the installation:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/markchad/
rm -rf ~/.cache/markchad/
rm -rf ~/.local/share/markchad/
```
